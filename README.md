The goal of this was just to make change using javascript.
I wanted to put it in the DOM and one thiing led to another.
The code is jumbled, brittle, and probably non-sense in some places.
--but it works (kinda).

it needs refactoring in several places. i've learned a lot here but it's time to move on to the other exercises.

live and learn.
